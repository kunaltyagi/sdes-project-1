\maketitle
The Van der Pol oscillator is a non-conservative oscillator with
non-linear damping.  It evolves in time according to the second-order
differential equation \cite{wiki, slides}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2x}{dt} - \mu (1 - x^2)\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the position coordinateâ€”which is a function of the time $t$, and
$\mu$ is a scalar parameter indicating the nonlinearity and the strength of
the damping.

These plots were generated by using the transformation $y = \dot(x)$
giving us the following set of Ordinary Differential Equations, which
was solved using \textbf{scipy}.
\begin{align}
    \dot(x) &= y\\
    \dot{y} &= \mu(1- x^2)y - x
\end{align}

The following plots were generated by changing the initial position as
well as the damping factor. Here, time is in \textbf{centi-seconds}.

From the plots it is clear that there are two regimes in the oscillator:
\begin{itemize}
        \item At $\mu$ = 0, it is the equation of a simple harmonic
            oscillator
        \item At $\mu > $0, near $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, it is unstable, and
            stable otherwise. See Figure \ref{fig:variation}
\end{itemize}
